# ðŸ«€ Heart Failure Clinical Records - Survival Analysis Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is an **interactive Tableau dashboard** analyzing the Heart Failure Clinical Records dataset.  
It visualizes the relationship between **clinical, demographic, and lifestyle factors** with **patient survival status**.

The dashboard enables healthcare analysts, researchers, and students to identify **key predictors of survival** and uncover patterns in patient outcomes.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Compare **survival rates** across different clinical conditions and lifestyle factors
- Explore **distribution patterns** of medical measurements for survivors vs. deceased patients
- Provide an **easy-to-interpret visual tool** for heart failure data analysis
